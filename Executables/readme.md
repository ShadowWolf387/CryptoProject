Initially only Win32 files built from the C or C++ version with Mingw-32 (gcc7.0) or newer.

In the few cases where only a Quick Basic version exists, QB64 rebuilt with Mingw-32 (gcc 7.0) or higher will be used.

If Linux gets included, then files will likely be built with the newest gcc build available.

Note that there is a Linux version of QB64 and there is also Wine. For some of the comutationally or
file intensive programs you may want to use a native build from C or C++.
