Initially only Win32 files built from the C or C++ version with Mingw-32 (gcc8.x) or newer.
(usually 12-20KB if stripped but may be 40-60k otherwise)

In the few cases where only a Quick Basic version exists, QB64 rebuilt with Mingw-32 (gcc 8.x) or higher will be used.
(Usually files about 1Mb or larger)

If Linux gets included, then files will likely be built with the newest gcc build available.

Note that there is a Linux version of QB64 and there is also Wine. For some of the computationally or
file intensive programs you may want to use a native build from C or C++.
