# CryptoProject
These are all pencil and paper ciphers with utilities to generate statistics as well as break the ciphers.
Because they are simple command or console window programs, they should build and work under Linux or Windows.
By creating command line programs, portability becomes nearly universal if you have a C compiler (usually GCC).
Documentation will mostly be found on my tumblr crypto page.

All the software will be written in QuickBasic, C and/or C++. Source code is all open source and somewhat heavily commented.
The source files are intended to be easy to understand and follow even for beginners. With this in mind, I do not
take full advantage of language specific features though the C++ version is capable of living as a class in a larger project.
There could be a WinGUI and maybe a Linux GUI eventually.

If you intend to build your own, you will need a core set and the work files for each cipher or utility program.
Download a copy of QB64 and/or Dev-C++ with Mingw for Windows, or QB64 and GCC for Linux. This is all free software
and the same compilers that I use.

The C or C++ version of each program will be compiled and released as a Win32 executable. If there is enough demand
or someone willing to help, a Linux executable may also be compiled. For any other platforms, you should be able
to do a C or C++ build with GCC or other C/C++ compiler.
